### Hi there 👋

I'm Eugene, a Golang developer.

What I do:

- 🛠️ Build [Bazel rules](https://github.com/ekhabarov?tab=repositories&q=rules_&type=&language=&sort=) for fun and profit.
- 👯 Look for new opportunities. Permanently. Period.
- 📝 Write about [Golang](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/golang?utm_source=github), [gRPC/REST](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/api?utm_source=github), [Bazel](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/bazel?utm_source=github) and [code generation](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/generators?utm_source=github).
- ⚡ Fun fact: there is no fun about me.
