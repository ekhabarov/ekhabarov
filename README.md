### Hi there 👋

I'm Eugene, a Golang developer and a founder at [PowerFly Consulting](https://powerfly.ca).

What I do:

- 🛠️ Build [gRPC](https://github.com/topics/grpc) and [REST APIs](https://github.com/topics/rest) for fun and profit.
- 👯 Look for new opportunities. Permanently. Period.
- 📝 Write about [Golang](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/golang/), [gRPC/REST](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/api/), [Bazel](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/bazel/) and [code generation](https://ekhabarov.com/tags/generators/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: there is no fun about me.
